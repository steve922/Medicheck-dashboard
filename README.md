# Medicheck Dashboard

This project demonstrates a simple Express API and React frontend.

## Setup

Install dependencies for both server and client:

```bash
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

## Running

Start the API server and the React development server in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal A
cd server
npm start

# Terminal B
cd client
npm start
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000> and you should see `API OK` rendered.
